# Primer Design Sandbox

## Purpose

This sandbox allows designers and developers to experiment with search interface patterns, test user interaction flows, and iterate on query construction approaches.

## Overview

This application serves as a design sandbox for testing and refining search interface concepts.

### Try this out when Figma falls short
- **Complex Interactions**: Figma's great for lots of things, but not interactions that require typing, calculating things, visualizing data, interacting with maps, and a handful of others.
- **Browser Affordances**: Clickable hotspots, scrolling, cursor changes, and other browser affordances can be impactful on a concept test. Try prototyping in the browser when you feel it might play an outsized role on the data you collect from a user.

## Usage Tips

- **Avoid Rabbit Holes**: It's easy to fall into a hole when prototyping in the browser. Think: perfect need not be the enemy of good.
- **Look to the Console Logs**: One of the hardest parts about prototyping this way for designers is debugging. Have command tools open and look out for console errors. When you see one, feed it back to your LLM and it'll likely solve the problem for you. 

## Technical Implementation

Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No dependencies required, and you don't need to start a server to run it. Just open index.html in your browser.
